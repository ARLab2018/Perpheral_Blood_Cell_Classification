# Perpheral_Blood_Cell_Classification
## Introduction
  This Project Classifies the Blood Cell types using a 13-layer CNN Network.

## Dataset
  The open available Dataset was provided by Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, [PBC_dataset_normal](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/1).

  It appears to be that the Dataset has high class imbalance which was reduced by using weighted random sampling, and data augmentation.
